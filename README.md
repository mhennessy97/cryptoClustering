# cryptoClustering

-The jupyter notebook provided uses sklearn to analyze cryptocurrency data. The dataset was condensed and clustered together to determine price changes.

-When using less features, the results remained similar to the original analysis with the elbow curve remaining around 4. 

-The variance was around 89% after the data was transformed, so around 10% was lost which is a trade-off of using this method.
